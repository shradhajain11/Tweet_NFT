# Analyzing NFT Tweets using Machine Learning

This project involves analyzing tweets related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using machine learning. The data used in this project is in the "Tweet_NFT.xlsx - Sheet1.csv" file and contains information on various aspects of the tweets, such as the text of the tweet, the date and time it was created, and the intent of the tweet (e.g., community, appreciation, giveaway, etc.).

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, run the following command to run the project:

```
python nft_tweet_analysis.py
```

This will analyze the NFT tweets dataset using machine learning and output various metrics.

## Results

The dataset is analyzed using various techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms such as natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. The results of the analysis are displayed in the output, which includes the total number of entries in the dataset, the number of null values in each column, and the head of the dataset.
